# Setting up PostGIS

The current setup is for Fedora Linux 20, and all the dependencies are already present in [CompJournoStick](http://znmeb.github.io/CompJournoStick/). It's pretty easy to port this to RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu or openSUSE. I'll do that once we know where servers, etc. are going to reside, but for now I'm staying on the Fedora desktop.

1. Install PostGIS and QGIS.
```
./yum-install-dependencies.bash
```
1. Configure PostgreSQL
```
./configure-postgresql.bash
```
